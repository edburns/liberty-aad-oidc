# Securing Open Liberty Applications with Azure Active Directory via OpenID Connect

Nowadays, more and more modern applications are secured by external security provider, which provides the benefit that applications no longer need to own and manage users' credentials. Open Liberty also supports relevant security features, e.g., [Social Media Login](https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html), [SAML Web Single Sign-on](https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#samlWeb-2.0.html) and [OpenID Connect Client](https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#openidConnectClient-1.0.html). In blog "[Securing Open Liberty apps and microservices with MicroProfile JWT and Social Media login](https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/08/29/securing-microservices-social-login-jwt.html)", it gave a solid example on how to use Open Liberty Social Media Login feature to authenticate users using their existing social media credentials. In this blog, let's take a look at another example about how to use Open Liberty OpenID Connect Client feature to secure apps with [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc).

## Set up Azure Active Directory
Azure Active Directory (AAD) implements OpenID Connect (OIDC), an authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0, which lets you securely sign in a user from AAD to an application. Before going into the sample code, you need to first set up AAD tenant and create an application registration with client secret. The tenant id, application id & client secret are used by Open Liberty OpenID Connect Client to negotiate with AAD to complete [OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow). Refer to the following articles on how to set it up:
- [Create a new tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Register an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Add a new client secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#request-the-permissions-in-the-app-registration-portal)
